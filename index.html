	 <p align="center"><b><font face="TimesRoman" size="4" color="#000080">California</font></b> </p> 
	 <p align="left"><font size="3"> The territory of the present State of
		California was discovered in 1542 by a Portuguese navigator in the Spanish
		service, J. R. Cabrillo. In 1578 Sir Francis Drake landed at Drake's Bay,
		opened communication with the natives, and took possession of the country in
		the name of England, calling it New Albion. It was explored by the Spaniard S.
		Viscayno in 1602, but no attempt was made at colonization until the Franciscan
		Fathers established a mission at San Diego in 1769. Within the next 50 years
		they founded 21 missions and gathered 20,000 Indians about them, but the number
		of neophytes continually fell off and the power of the missions declined with
		them, especially after Mexican government had succeeded to Spanish. Transfer of
		the country to the United States and the rush of immigrants following upon the
		discovery of gold in 1848 was still more disastrous to the Indians and this
		disaster extended to parts of the State which the Spaniards had not reached.
		From this time on the history of the Indians of this area is one long story of
		debauchery and extermination. Reservations were set aside for most of the
		tribes, but the greater part of the survivors live scattered through the
		country as squatters or on land purchased by themselves.</font> </p>
	 <p align="left"><font size="3"> In dealing
		with the tribes of California, I have adopted the names given by Dr. Kroeber in
		his Handbook of the Indians of California (1925). An inspection of these shows
		us at once, however, that the tribal concept in most parts of the State is one
		imposed upon the Indians as a result of ethnological investigation rather than
		something recognized by themselves. It has a dialectic rather than a
		governmental or ceremonial base, but it is the best that can be done unless we
		adopt the impracticable alternative of treating each village group as a tribe.
		It is to be understood that, from the ordinary point of view as to what
		constitutes a tribe, this expedient is largely artificial. Under these
		circumstances it has seemed best not to follow a strictly alphabetic system
		throughout, or rather, to enter those tribes defined by their names as parts of
		larger groups under the more common group names, the qualifying word following,
		as: Paiute, Northern, and Yuki, Coast, instead of Northern Paiute and Coast
		Yuki.</font> </p>
	 <p align="left"><font size="3"> <b><i> Connections in which they have become
     noted.� </i></b>That few names of
		California tribes have found permanent lodgment in the geography of the region
		is not surprising when we consider the small number of names of this kind at
		all prominent. This is in keeping with the fact that tribal organizations as
		they were known in eastern North America were wanting over much of the State,
		and that where they existed they were generally small and insignificant. It
		also happens that a few real tribal names, or names that have been used to
		cover tribal groups, include peoples which extended into neighboring States and
		have been treated elsewhere. Under this head come the names of Modoc County,
		Klamath River, Mohave River, Mono County and Lake, and Piute Peak. Still other
		names are derived from villages and small tribes, mere subdivisions of the main
		bodies. Among these may be mentioned Tuolumne County, Mokelumne Peak and River,
		Cosumnes River, Kaweah River. While the designation of the Shasta is a
		conspicuous one it is rather the mountain which has given name to the tribe
		than the tribe to the mountain, though in fact both are derived from a chief of
		the Shasta people. Following from the use of the term for Mount Shasta we have
		Shasta River, Shasta, Shasta Retreat, Shasta Springs. The history of the name
		Hupa has been somewhat similar. It has remained attached to the valley to which
		it was originally applied and to the tribe secondarily. Nevertheless, the
		valley name now serves to preserve in memory that of the people who occupied
		it.</font> </p>

		language, Kroeber (1925) inferred that these people had occupied their country
		for a long time but later researches by Whorf (1935) make this less certain.
		The first white person to visit them was Father Garces in 1776 and during the
		next 50 years they were brought in contact with the San Buena Ventura Mission,
		founded in 1782 near Ventura. By 1846 white settlers had established ranches in
		South Fork Valley, and in 1857 the Kern River gold rush began in Palagewan
		territory. During 1862 a few T<font face="Times New Roman">�</font>batulabal joined the Owens Valley Paiute in
		hostilities against the Whites, and about this time a group of Koso Indians
		settled in the Tubatulabal area, intermarrying chiefly with the Kawaiisu,
		however. In 1863, 35-40 T�batulabal and Palagewan men were massacred near
		Kernville by American soldiers. Between 1865 and 1875 the T<font face="Times New Roman">�</font>batulabal began to
		practice agriculture and in 1893 the majority of them and a few Palagewan
		survivors were allotted land in South Fork and Kern
		Valleys.</font> </p>

		estimate of 1,000 T<font face="Times New Roman">�</font>batulabal for the year 1770 but Voegelin (1938) regards
		this as "probably too high." Henley in 1854 gives a figure of 100 which seems
		to apply to the T<font face="Times New Roman">�</font>batulabal and Palagewan Bands, but Voegelin points out that
		it may be necessary to double this on account of a band temporarily absent from
		the country, and the same writer estimates that Henley indicates a band of
		perhaps 50 which may have been the Bankalachi. A village sit estimate obtained
		by Voegelin (1938) from native informants suggested a total about 1855-60 of
		228 T<font face="Times New Roman">�</font>batulabal, and 65 Palagewan, or 293 combined. An estimate for 1863 based
		on the total of adult males indicates a population of 220. The United States
		Census of 1910 returned 105 and a field census taken by Voegelin in 1832
